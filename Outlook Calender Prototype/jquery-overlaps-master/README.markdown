# overlaps

A jQuery plugin that detects if one or more elements are overlapping.

The overlaps method exposes two modes of operation. First mode is to filter the selected elements to only those that overlap. The second mode is to compare one set of elements against another and return only the elements that overlap.

    // filter result set
    $('div').overlaps();
    
    // test if one element overlaps another
    $('#div1').overlaps('#div2');
